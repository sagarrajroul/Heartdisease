# Heartdisease

We have a data which classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features in it. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use logistic regression (classification) and Decision Tree algorithm.

* sex — (1 = male; 0 = female)
* cp — chest pain type
* trestbps — resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
* chol — serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fbs — (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
* restecg — resting electrocardiographic results
* thalach — maximum heart rate achieved
* exang — exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* oldpeak — ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* slope — the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* ca — number of major vessels (0–3) colored by flourosopy
* thal — 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
* target — have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
